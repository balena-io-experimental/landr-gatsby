# Landr components and content types

Every page in landr is composed of a number of components. Based on the types of content of that page, each component decides how some sub set of that content should be rendered. For example, a list of Faqs will be rendered on the homepage just above the footer. Below is the list of all the components and their corresponding types of content as well as where that content is expected to be.

**Note:** _Some types of content are generic and is usually used across the site. For example, the logo. You can find these listed after the components below._
