# Conventions

Landr prides itself with being a zero configuration tool, and relying on your
repository and related conventions to perform its job.

This document presents a list of conventions we recommend in order to make the
best out of Landr. Apart from this list, The [Landr GitHub Repository](https://github.com/balena-io/landr) aims to be an example of what
you can do with Landr, so check out how we do things there if unsure!

## `README.md`

### Image Banner

Landr will parse the `README` file and if it finds an image at the top, it will
use it as the project banner/logo.

### Logo Brandmark

A brandmark logo only consist of the logo without the text. Landr will look for `logo.png` if present in the root directory, which will be used as favicon

### Description

The first paragraph in the `README` before any section is considered to be the
repository description.

### Features

A list of paragraphs after the repository description, where each entry starts
with a set of words, a colon, and a paragraph is considered to be the project
features highlights.

### Motivation

A `README` section called `Motivation` is considered to be a longer description
of why the project exists.

## `ARCHITECTURE.md`

potential contributors.

## `FAQ.md`

repository.

## `CONTRIBUTING.md`

complementary to the `ARCHITECTURE.md` document.
