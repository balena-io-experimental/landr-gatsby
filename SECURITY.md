# Reporting Security Issues

The Balena.io team and community take security bugs in all our products and
open source projects seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly
disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

To report a security issue, email
[security@balena.io](mailto:security@balena.io). The Balena.io team will keep
you informed of the progress towards a fix, and may ask for additional
information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the [Node Security
Project](https://nodesecurity.io/report).
